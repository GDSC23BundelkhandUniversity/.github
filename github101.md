# Welcome to GitHub 101

This repository is your beginner's guide to understanding GitHub and how it works. Whether you're a developer, a student, or someone curious about version control and collaboration, you've come to the right place!

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that facilitates version control and collaborative software development. It's a place where developers and teams can work together to build, maintain, and share software projects. GitHub uses a distributed version control system called Git, which allows you to track changes in your codebase, collaborate with others, and manage your project effectively.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To start using GitHub, you don't need to install anything on your local machine. You can access GitHub through your web browser at [https://github.com](https://github.com). Simply create an account, and you're ready to go!

### Basic Concepts

Here are some fundamental concepts you should know:

- **Repository (Repo)**: A repository is where your project lives. It contains your code, documentation, and project history.

- **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It records changes to your codebase.

- **Branch**: A branch is a parallel version of your repository. You can create branches to work on new features or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase.

- **Pull Request (PR)**: A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows collaborators to review and discuss your changes before merging them.

- **Fork**: Forking a repository creates a copy of it in your account. You can make changes in your fork and later send a pull request to the original repository to propose your changes.
